# Credit Card Financial Dashboard

This repository contains the resources and instructions to develop a comprehensive Credit Card Weekly Dashboard using Power BI. This dashboard provides real-time insights into key performance metrics and trends, enabling stakeholders to effectively monitor and analyze credit card operations.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a dynamic and informative dashboard that showcases various performance indicators related to credit card operations. The process involves data importation, processing, visualization, and updating, all of which contribute to the creation of a reliable and insightful dashboard.

## Steps to Develop the Dashboard

### 1. Import Data to SQL Database

1. **Create Tables in SQL:**
   - Design and create the necessary tables in the SQL database to store the imported data.

2. **Import CSV Files into SQL:**
   - Import the provided CSV files into the created SQL tables using appropriate SQL commands or tools.

3. **Import Tables to Power BI:**
   - Connect Power BI to the SQL database and import the tables to start building the dashboard.

### 2. Data Processing

- Write DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) queries to process and filter the imported data. This step ensures that the data is ready for analysis and visualization.

### 3. Creating Visualizations

- Develop appropriate visualizations for the required metrics and performance indicators. Use Power BI to create charts, graphs, and other visual elements that effectively represent the data.
- Design a weekly report that highlights the key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends.

### 4. Adding New Data

- Update the SQL database with new data (e.g., adding the 31st week's data).
- Ensure that the dashboard reflects this new data accurately and updates the visualizations and reports accordingly.
